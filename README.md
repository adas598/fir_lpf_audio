# Simple Audio Processing using FIR Low-Pass Filter

## 1. Introduction
This was a college based mini-project for the digital signal processing lab course.
In this project, you will understand how to simulate an input noisy sample to be filtered by adding gaussian noise of a specific frequency, which the user can decide in the MATLAB script.

## 2. Organization of files in the repository
1. "Recording(2).m4a" - Input clear sample
2. "dsp_project.m" - Main MATLAB file
3. "Report.pdf" - Project documentation
